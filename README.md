<p>
Karen a "user" has created a ticket.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Karen receives a confirmation and John a new hire at osTicket observes that a ticket was created.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
John escalates the ticket to me for triage, during which I update the Priority Level, Service Level Agreement (SLA) plan, and Help Topic as appropriate.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Following triage, I escalated the ticket to Jane Doe, a Systems Administrator within the Online Banking department.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Once Jane opens the ticket, she can review the documented details necessary to assess the issue and determine the appropriate support actions for Karen.

</p>
<p>
Jane reviews the ticket and responds to Karen, as she is aware of a previously identified incident related to the issue.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Jane documents the root cause, applies the necessary remediation, verifies service restoration, and formally closes the ticket.
